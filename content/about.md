# Hi there

My name is rexarski. This is my proof of concept site for documenting experiments and explorations.

Here you'll find expendable experiments, but documented. Each post represents a learning journey or an investigation into something interesting.

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Terminal theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal).
